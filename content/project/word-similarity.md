# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "This project aims to develop a metric to measure similarity between words taking into account the effects of different types of changes in phonemes and syllables.Different types of changes can be modifications at a syllable or at phoneme levels such as deletion of a phoneme/syllable or substitution of a phoneme/syllable at different positions in the word. We will first measure the impact of changes on the probability of confusing the original word with the modified word that is the word after the modification is applied. With the probabilities at hand, we will develop a metric that can measure the distance of the original and modified word and create a distance space for words that can help us measure the overall similarity between two words depending on their differences. This measurement is going to be at a psychological level. On top of this measurement, we will add phonological and semantic similarity between words and aim to develop a similarity metric that takes into account multiple levels that can affect perception and memory for words."
