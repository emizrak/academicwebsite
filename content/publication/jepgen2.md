abstract = "Giving people more time between encoding information elements into working memory improves
immediate (i.e., working memory) and delayed (i.e., long-term memory) retrieval. This free-time benefit is
often assumed to arise from processes that counteract forgetting of the just encoded item in working
memory, suggesting that time has a retroactive effect. Contrary to these predictions, a few studies showed
that free time between two items in a serial recall task benefits only the subsequent (to-be-encoded) items,
yielding a proactive benefit in working memory. Here, we investigate whether working memory and long-term
memory benefit from free time in the same way. In three experiments, we show that free time benefits
the to-be-encoded items in working memory (proactive effect) with only a local retroactive effect for
recently encoded items, whereas it mainly benefits already encoded items in long-term memory (retroactive
benefit). These results challenge a single explanation of the free-time benefit for memory retention across
short and long intervals."
