abstract = "Giving people more time to process information in working memory improves their performance on working memory tasks. It is often assumed that free time given after presentation of an item enables maintenance processes to counteract forgetting of this item, suggesting that time has a retroactive benefit. Two other hypotheses—short-term consolidation and temporal distinctiveness—entail a local effect of time on immediately preceding and following items. Here, we show instead a novel global and proactive benefit of time in working memory. In three serial-recall experiments (Ns = 21, 25, and 26 young adults, respectively), we varied the position and duration of the free time within a seven-item list of consonants. Experiment 1 showed that the effect is global and not local. Experiments 2a and 2b showed that increased interitem time benefited performance only for the subsequent items, implying a proactive benefit. This finding rules out maintenance processes, short-term consolidation, and temporal distinctiveness as explanations of the free-time benefit but is consistent with the proposal of a gradually recovering encoding resource."

abstract_short = "Working memory is our mind’s blackboard, where we can keep information available briefly— for instance, we can hold a new phone number in working memory and then type it from memory. The passage of time is usually associated with forgetting of information held in working memory: Many researchers believe that information in working memory fades quickly unless we rehearse it by repeating it to ourselves. In contrast to this idea, research shows that if we pause in between adding items to working memory, our memory improves. We investigated what people use these pauses for. For instance, one could use a pause to go over what is already in working memory (e.g., rehearsal). Instead, we found that pauses improve recall of information that is added to working memory after the pause without leading to any forgetting of items already in working memory before the pause. This finding suggests that pauses (i.e., time) help working memory prepare for future information and calls for a new way of thinking about the role of time in working memory."
